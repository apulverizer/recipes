category: dessert

ingredients:
- 5 tbsp flour , plain/all purpose
- 1 cup white sugar , regular/granulated
- 1 cup milk, warmed using any method
- 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- Pinch of salt
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- (for chocoloate frosting) 1/4 cup cocoa powder, unsweetened 

directions:
- Place flour and sugar in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, for 30 seconds.
- While whisking constantly, slowly pour the milk in (this ensure it's lump free).
- Cook until the mixture thickens in a thick, dolloping custard - see video for texture.
- Remove from heat and scrape into a bowl. Cover with cling wrap, pressing down onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming. Cool completely, about an hour.
- Place butter in a bowl and use either a handheld beater or stand mixer (with whisk attachment) to beat for 3 minutes until it's smooth and changes from yellow to very pale yellow, almost white.
- Now start whipping in the Thickening Roux. On speed 5 (medium), start adding the thick roux one heaped tablespoon at a time. Take about 1 minute to add it all.
- Once all added, add vanilla and salt, then whip for 2 to 3 minutes until you can see that it is still enough to hold peaks.
- Beat in the cocoa powder, if desired
