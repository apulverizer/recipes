tags: 
- baking
category: side

ingredients:
- 3 cups flour
- 3 cups cornmeal
- 1/2 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger
- 1 tablespoon pumpkin pie spice
- 6 large eggs
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 2 cups half-and-half
- 1 cup sour cream
- 1 cup butter, softened
- 2 tablespoons honey

directions:
- Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking pan. (Note, The batter completely filled the pan as it rose during baking, so do not use a shallow baking dish, and do not try to substitute a smaller pan.)
- With a whisk, stir together flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, ginger and pumpkin pie spice until there are no more lumps of brown sugar.
- In a separate bowl, beat together eggs, buttermilk, half-and-half, sour cream and butter. Beat on high speed (or the highest speed possible without splashing too much) at least 2 full minutes. Lower speed to medium and beat in honey. Beat in flour mixture, about 1 cup at a time, being sure each cup is completely absorbed before adding another.
- Pour into pan and bake 30 minutes; rotate pan 180 degrees and bake another 30 minutes. Corn bread is done when a knife inserted into the center comes out clean, with a few crumbs sticking to it.
