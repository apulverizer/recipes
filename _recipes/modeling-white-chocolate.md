ingredients:
- 7oz white chocolate, chopped
- 1 1/2-2 Tbsp light corn syrup

directions:
- Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or metal bowl set over a pan of simmering water. 
- Stir the chocolate until melted and smooth. 
- Remove from heat and stir until smooth and cooled a bit. 
- Stir in the corn syrup. 
- The chocolate will stiffen almost immediately. 
- Stir until completely combined. 
- Transfer the chocolate to a sturdy plastic freezer bag and refrigerate until firm (about 2 hours). 
- When the dough is firm, remove from the refrigerator, and knead it until it is soft enough to work with. 
- If it is too hard, cut off small pieces and knead until pliable. 
- Grease the counter where you are working with oil or spray with Pam so the chocolate won't stick.
