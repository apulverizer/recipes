- 1/4  teaspoon dried oregano
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

directions:
- Combine smoked paprika, cayenne pepper, dried thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper,  oregano and salt in a Ziploc bag.  Shake to combine.
- Brush chicken breasts lightly on both sides with oil or spray with baking spray. Use your hands to spread the seasonings evenly over the chicken.
- Heat one tablespoon canola oil in a nonstick skillet over medium to medium high heat until it is smoking. Cook chicken until it is golden brown (almost black) on both sides and cooked through; approximately 5 minutes each side. Remove from skillet.
