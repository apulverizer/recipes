ingredients:
- 2 tsp olive oil
- 1-1/2 lbs. Italian sausage
- 1 bell pepper, diced
- 1 onion, diced
- 4 large garlic cloves, minced
- 2 tsp dried oregano
- 1/2 tsp kosher salt
- 1/4 tsp ground black pepper
- 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes
- 3 Tbsp tomato paste
- 2 (14.5-oz.) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes
- 2 bay leaves
- 6 cup low-sodium chicken stock
- 8 oz mafalda or fusilli pasta
- 1/2 cup fresh basil leaves, sliced thinly
- 8 oz. ricotta
- 1/2 c. grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 tsp. kosher salt
- freshly ground black pepper, to taste
- 2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese


directions:
- Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add sausage and brown for 3 minutes, breaking it up into bite-size pieces with a wooden spoon.
- Add onion, garlic, oregano, salt, pepper, and red pepper flakes, and cook until onion is softened and sausage is browned, about 7 more minutes.
- Stir in tomato paste and cook for 2 minutes more.
- Add diced tomatoes, bay leaves, and chicken stock. Bring just to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 15 minutes.
- Meanwhile, prepare pasta in a separate saucepan according to package directions, to el dente. Do not over cook. Drain.
- In a medium bowl, create the "cheesy yum" by combining the ricotta, Parmesan, salt, and pepper. Set aside.
- Stir fresh basil into soup right before serving.
- To serve, add cooked pasta to individual bowls and ladle soup over the top. Serve with dollops of cheesy yum and additional shredded mozzarella.
