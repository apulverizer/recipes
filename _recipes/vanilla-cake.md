ingredients:
- 2 cups plain / all purpose flour (cake flour OK too, Note 1)
- 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder (check it's still active, Note 2)
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 4 large eggs (50 – 55g / 2 oz each), at room temp (Note 3)
- 1 1/2 cups caster / superfine sugar (granulated/regular ok too, Note 2)
- 115g / 1/2 cup unsalted butter , cut into 1.5cm / 1/2” cubes (or so)
- 1 cup milk , full fat (Note 5)
- 3 tsp vanilla extract , the best you can afford (Note 6)
- 3 tsp vegetable or canola oil (Note 7)

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F
- Grease 2 8” cake pans with butter, then line with parchment / baking paper.
- Whisk flour, baking powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.
- Beat eggs for 30 seconds on speed 6 of a Stand Mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, or hand beater.
- With the beater still going, pour the sugar in over 45 seconds.
- Then beat for 7 minutes on speed 8, or until tripled in volume and white.
- While egg is beating, place butter and milk in a heatproof jug and microwave 2 minutes on high to melt butter (or use stove). Do not let milk bubble and boil (foam ok). Don’t do this ahead and let the milk cool (this affects rise).
- When the egg is whipped, scatter 1/3 flour across surface, gradually add remaining flour - stop mixing when flour is fully mixed in.
- Pour hot milk, vanilla and oil into the now empty flour bowl. Add about 1 1/2 cups (2 ladles or so) of the Egg Batter into the Milk-Butter (don't need to be 100% accurate with amount). Use a whisk to mix until smooth – you can be vigorous here. Will look foamy.
- Turn beater back on Speed 1 then pour the Milk mixture into the Egg Batter over 15 seconds, then turn beater off.
- Scrape down sides and base of bowl. Beat on Speed 1 for 10 seconds – batter should now be smooth and pourable.
- Pour batter into pans. 
- Bang each cake pan on the counter 3 times to knock out big bubbles (Note 10 for why)
- Bake 30 minutes or until golden and toothpick inserted into centre comes out clean.
