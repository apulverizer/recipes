ingredients:
- 2 cups all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled (240g)
- 1 1/2 tsp baking powder
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened (113g)
- 3/4 cup granulated white sugar (150g)
- 2 large eggs
- 1/4 cup sour cream (60g)
- 2 vanilla beans* (or 2 tsp vanilla extract)
- 1/2 cup milk (120ml)
- 1 1/2 cups raspberries (225g)
- 2 tbsp all-purpose flour

directions:
- Preheat oven to 350°F / 175°C. Line the bottom and the sides of a 9" (23cm) springform pan with parchment paper. Set aside.
- In a large bowl combine 2 cups flour, baking powder, and salt and stir to combine. Set aside.
- In a large mixing bowl with a stand or handheld mixer fitted with a whisk or paddle attachment, beat butter and sugar until creamy for about 2-3 minutes. Add 1 egg at the time and mix until incorporated. Add sour cream and vanilla* and stir to combine. Alternately add dry ingredients and milk, beginning and ending with dry ingredients. Stir just until combined. Set aside.
- Place raspberries and 2 tbsp flour in a bowl and stir with a spoon to combine until the raspberries are fully covered with flour.
- Transfer raspberries to the batter without the excess flour in the bowl. Fold in with a spatula or wooden spoon carefully. Transfer to the prepared baking pan and bake for about 32-36 minutes or until a toothpick in the center comes out clean. I baked mine for 34 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.
- Before serving, sprinkle with powdered sugar, top with whipping cream, or fresh raspberries, to your preference. Store leftovers in the fridge up to 1 day.
