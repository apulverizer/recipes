ingredients:
- 1 tablespoon ghee (or vegetable oil)
- 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1" cubes
- 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
- 1 jalapeno pepper, seeded and minced
- 3 tablespoons prepared ginger paste
- 2 teaspoons garam masala
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon turmeric
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 1 tablespoon minced garlic
- 2 large tomatoes, chopped
- 1/2 cup golden raisins
- 1 cup uncooked basmati rice
- 2 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth*
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves
- 1/4 cup sliced unsalted almonds
- 1 lime, cut into wedges


directions:
- Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a large nonstick skillet or frying pan. Once the oil is shimmering, add the chicken pieces and let them cook, undisturbed, for 3-5 minutes until golden brown.
- Turn the chicken pieces and add the onion, jalapeno, ginger, salt, garam masala, cumin, turmeric, and salt. Saute for 3 minutes, or until the onions have softened.
- Add the garlic, tomatoes, and raisins to the pan. Stir well, then add the rice and broth. Allow the liquid to come to a boil, then cover the pan and turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the rice steam for 15 minutes. Turn off the heat and fluff the rice with a fork. Re-cover the pan, and allow the rice to continue to steam for another 10 minutes.
- Garnish with cilantro leaves and almond slices. Serve the Biryani straight out of the pan, accompanied by lime wedges for squeezing.
