ingredients:
- 1 pkg Oreo Cookies, divided
- 1/2 cup butter, melted
- 8 oz cream cheese
- 1 cup powdered sugar
- 1 large tub Cool Whip, divided
- 2 small boxes (3.1 oz each) instant chocolate pudding mix
- 3 cups milk

directions:
- Crush up 2/3 of the Oreos and mix in melted butter. Press cookie crumb mixture into the bottom of a 9X13-inch pan and press firmly to form the crust. 
- Mix together cream cheese, powdered sugar, and 1/2 of the Cool Whip. Spread over Oreo crust. 
- Mix together both packages of chocolate pudding mix and the milk. Refrigerate about 20 minutes until the pudding thickens. Spread over the cream cheese layer. 
- Spread the remaining Cool Whip over the pudding. Place the remaining Oreos into a plastic tip-top bag and smash into medium-sized pieces. You should have some chunks of cookies and some crumbs. Sprinkle oreo pieces and crumbs over the Cool Whip. Refrigerate at least 3 hours before serving.
